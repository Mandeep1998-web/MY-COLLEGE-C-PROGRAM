#--> Wild pointer = is uninitialized pointer
#--> Dangling pointer = have the invalid address of free memory.
int *p;
*p=7;
#--> Null pointer = int *p=NULL(capital letters) so NULL value is declare in macro and that is 0 so
if we assign it NULL that means we consider it as it points no location.
#-->Void Pointer = void pointer does have a void type , means if i write int *p; so it can allow the int type value so if i have void *p that means
it is a generic pointer which can point to any type of value and when we have to access it we do typecasting that *(float)*p=4;
